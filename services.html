			<h1>How Can We Help?</h1>
		</div>
		<div class='column width65'>
			<h3>Cultural Drift</h3>
			<p>When your organization doubles in size, things get fuzzy. That tight-knit work family who could finish each other's sentences morphs into an uncoordinated tribe that can’t agree on how the work should get done. Sales suffer.</p>
			<h3>Piece-meal Training</h3>
			<p>Sales training usually starts as a side job for people in marketing, product, HR, and even IT. Those people are now busy scaling in their own departments. The head of sales is out closing the big deals. Training sputters. Sales suffer.</p>
			<h3>You Promised What?!</h3>
			<p>When reps are onboarded too quickly they lack the knowledge and perspective they need to properly manage client expectations. As the product grows and changes they need to be kept in the loop. Without that, bad promises get made. Clients are disappointed. Sales suffer.</p>
			<h3>Drowning In Documents</h3>
			<p>Slide decks, territory maps, training videos, demo scripts, product specs… 6 months ago they were brand new. Now they’re out of date and piling up. Reps can’t find what they need when they need it and stick to the out of date stuff that they already know. Sales suffer.</p>

			<h1>Engagement<br/> Model</h1>
		</div>
		<div class='column width65'>
			<p>While we tailor every engagement to our clients' needs, our work generally unfolds in the following stages:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h2>Explore</h2>
					<p>Our goal is to understand the current state of learning in your organization. This typically involves 1:1 interviews, role design workshops, and a learning culture assessment. Then we design a set of practices and tools for use in the next stage.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Prototype</h2>
					<p>Here we test those practices and tools with a single team and tweak it as needed. We work with real people and roles, using retrospectives and direct engagement to gather feedback and make adjustments. The outcome is a more refined pathway for growth, plus a team to help scale the system in the following stage.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Refine</h2>
					<p>At this point we scale this system using a “mitosis” approach: each team trains another team. This make the scaling process exponential (2 teams, then 4, then 8, etc.) Training others deepens their understanding of the system. And the system becomes an internal collaboration rather than an external solution. Throughout we support teams, report on progress, and measure engagement.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Calibrate</h2>
					<p>As your people settle into the tools and practices, we gradually release responsibility for the learning culture. This includes weekly check-ins with internal champions, triage meetings, and minor system adjustments. The final result is a clear pathway for growth in your organization. One that is built on a culture of learning that engages, retains, and develops your people.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h1>How We Work</h1>
		</div>
		<div class='column width65'>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Weekly Sprints:</b> We define the work on Monday and we ship on Friday, week in and week out. All our work is tracked in Trello and completely transparent to you. You know exactly what’s happening at any time.</li>
				<li><b>Gradual Release Of Responsibility:</b> We design self-sustaining systems, i.e. we work ourselves out of a job. As the learning system and culture take hold we gradually remove ourselves and build capacity with internal champions.</li>
