        Each month the PLC team sends a 6-question survey to each active product council across Pearson. The results tell us about the level and rigor of activity around PLC across the business. The long term goal is to get the charts to go up and to the right. However, in the short term these are important indicators of where and how the PLC team can support these groups as they transition to a more responsive and agile way of managing products.

        Each chart below includes a basic overview and a some notes about the latest month's data. <strong>All charts are up to date as of: <mark class="text-uppercase">August 16, 2016</mark></strong>

                Product council meetings are the basic pulse of PLC. We like to see them happening at least once each month per council. A few do them ad hoc because of a small portfolio. Others need to meet more often than that. It's just a rule of thumb.

                Product Life Cycle templates help to organize product information within the PLC framework. They pose important questions that ensure we are getting out of the building, talking with clients, identifying risky assumptions and gathering evidence that de-risks our ideas. Any council visible in the chart is using the templates.

                The number of products being reviewed at a product council meeting -- regardless of whether a decision is made -- points towards how much of our portfolio is being governed within the PLC method.

                Just because a product goes to council doesn't mean that a decision is being made whether or not to invest. So we track the number of actual decisions made in order to determine the financial aspect of PLC activity. The goal is to make smaller, faster bets that are based on real engagement with customers.

                PLC coaches represent a level of fluency and influence around the PLC. Roughly speaking, the more coaches you have, the more fluent your business is in PLC methodology and thus the more decisions should be influenced by that thinking. It's not a perfect science, but it's a metric worth watching.

                Each council manages a portfolio of products. That portfolio needs to be mapped to Pearson's global product taxonomy. That mapping process is known as "product granularity." So this question is asking whether or not you've started that process. It's a scale of 1-4. The higher the number, the more fully mapped is their portfolio.
